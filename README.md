# Photoshop-NFT-Generator

This script will create unique compositions out of members contained within the top-level document groups, and save them into a desired location both as a `png`- and a `psd`-file. <br>
Tested on Photoshop CS6 Portable.

## Usage
1. Download and unzip `PS-LayerGenerator` `jsx`-file
2. Open your project and navigate to `File > Scripts > Browse...`
3. Browse and load the downloaded `jsx` file

Note: use prefix `__` (double underscore) for top-level group names to exclude groups from the composition composing process. E.g. `__ignoreThisGroup`
